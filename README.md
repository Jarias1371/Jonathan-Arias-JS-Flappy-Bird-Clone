# Jonathan-Arias-JS-Flappy-Bird-Clone


This was a tutorial I completed prior to starting our JavaScript modules. The tutorial was one I found on YouTube that wasn't guided and more of a watch and apply yourself tutorial. There was quite a bit of trial and error involved and I was able to have a better understanding of the way JS operates. 

I intend to go back and take what I learned with this tutorial and apply it to creating a transcribing the BASIC Oregon Trail code into JavaScript.
